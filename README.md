# 💸 Budget Buddy – Track It Before You Crack It

**Budget Buddy** is a lightweight, browser-based expense tracker built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**—designed specifically for students like Raghav who want a clean and simple way to manage their income and expenses. No sign-up, no server, and no complexity—just open your browser and take control of your money!

## 📌 Problem Statement

> Money management doesn't need to be complicated—and certainly not for a student like Raghav, who just wants to know where his money is going every month.

**Budget Buddy** solves the problem of:
- Lack of visibility in monthly spending.
- Scattered and forgettable manual tracking.
- Overly complex or bloated finance apps.
- Absence of graphical data representation in simple trackers.
